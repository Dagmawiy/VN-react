# Assigment

1. Make the provided E2E tests pass (ES6).
2. Keep server data in memory (lockal store atl. redux or flux).
3. Implement client-side validation of the form data (yup react hook).
4. Ensure that the frontend app remains responsive while the data is being loaded from the server. (useState isLoading / scss)
4. Unit test one module of choice. There is no need to test the whole app, as we only want to understand what you take into consideration when writing unit tests. (jest or unit test)
__________________________________________________________________________________

5. Avoid duplication and extract re-usable modules where it makes sense. We want to see your approach to creating a codebase that is easy to maintain.
6. Push your code to the new implementation branch. We encourage you to commit and push your changes regularly as it's a good way for you to showcase your thinking process.
7. Create a new pull request, but please do not merge it.(Github)
9. Document the tech decisions you've made by creating a new review on your PR (see how). In particular, describe how you've made the frontend responsive.
10. Await further instructions from the hiring team.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
